# Innocent Rogue
## Story hook
You're a man of the court.  A knight of the halls of the King, and you have been incorrectly accused and convicted of treason.  Your sentence?  Banishment to the maze of eternity.  So named, because in all the time it has existed, anyone sent there is expected to stay there for all eternity.

Your plan?  To escape, find out who framed you, and clear your name!

## Plan of action
Ok, so this is going to be my first roguelike/roguelite.  I'll be using Python initially, but trying not to use libraries/packages made specifically to do the hard stuff for you.  With this said I *will* be using packages such as numpy to allow for better datastructures than the base libaries provide.  Addtionally, the initial game will be based around ASCII.  I can apply tilesets later to override the ASCII characters, but for now, this is more of a learning exercise.  I **may** move towards more complex versions of this once I have an MVP in, and I'm happy with it.

- [ ] Create a gamewindow with a gameloop and a character (@)
- [ ] Add movement to the character via event handling
- [ ] Generate a single room with boundaries/walls
- [ ] Generate a small map using procedural generation techniques

This should do for now, but I'll update and add more as I progress.
